# Running Tasks

Once the tasks are configured, you can execute them with the _"Run"_ button.
The _"Run"_ button will **not** be visible in [Edit Mode](docs/getting-started/creating-tasks#edit-mode).

## Task output

At any time, (while not in _"Edit Mode"_) you can click on any task name to see the terminal output (`stdout` and `stderr`). The output is updated in real-time while the tasks is running.

The output will be cleared when running a task again.
