# Suites

:::caution WIP
Work In Progress
:::


Tasks are grouped in **Suites** that allow you to organize your tasks and run them in batch.
Suites are always visible on the top bar as tabs:

![Suites Tabs](/img/docs/suites_tabs.png)

You can change suites by selecting the tab. All running tasks will keep running when changing tabs.

## Creating suites
While in [Edit Mode](/docs/getting-started/creating-tasks#edit-mode), a "+" tab will appear next to your suites. Clicking the "+" tab will create a new suite.
